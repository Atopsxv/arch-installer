My very own arch install aka {ato install} was made to install the base packages thats needed in order to function the system and only needed ones.
Needed - {base linux linux-firmware networkmanager}  
Ive added the optional ones {base-devel,git} but how could an arch system not have those.


(ALL STILL IN PROGRESS)



Command for KDE install
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atopsxv/arch-installer/main/ato-kde.sh -o ato-kde.sh
```

Command for no DE just the terminal
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atopsxv/arch-installer/main/ato-tty.sh -o ato-tty.sh
```
